1) master - DO NOT TOUCH THIS
2) develop - branch off this
3) branch for each feature



Workflow:
 - branch off develop:
      > git checkout develop
      > get checkout -b (feature/name-of-my-feature)
 - work only in (feature/name-of-my-feautre)
 
 - git pull from develop into your feature branch
      > git checkout feature/name-of-my-feature
      > git merge develop
 
 - change into develop branch
     > git checkout develop
      
 - merge in the changes from your feature branch
     > git merge feature/name-of-my-feature
